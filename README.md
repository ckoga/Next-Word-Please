# Next Word Please

This application was built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).  The application was built for a code challenge that tests a developers ability to code in a new language/framework they are unfamiliar with.  Svelte proved to be a simple tansisition from React.js with a similar data flow, but the syntax was challenging for a good portion of the challenge.  Next Word Please is a basic application that  uses the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/) to get synonyms for a word the user inputs.
